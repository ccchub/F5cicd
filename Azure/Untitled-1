1. Have thought about moving to Majors for a while, and Finacial Service position opened up, it's a good fit
2. Worked with a number of large customers on the territory side as well, so it is not something new (e.g. Huges Networks, FINRA, Sentara Healthcare)
3. I am very interested in cutting edge technologies in Cloud, microservices, containers, API driven apps and DevOps, and FinSvc customers are heavily leaveraging these, vs. a small subset of territory customers.
4. I have done and rewritten a number of hive articles on:

1. BIG-IP in AWS and Azure
2. Kubernetes and containers with BIG-IP being ingress gateway
3. SSLO inbound for transparent WAF load balancing
4. Advanced authentication around APM (e.g. oAuth, OpenID Connect, SAML, JWT, Kerberos)
5. L2/L3 2-tier WAF deployment
6. AS3 declarative statement
7. Nginx Plus ingress controller in Azure Kuberbetes Services
